<p>
Additional embeddable build status configurations can be created for a Jenkins Pipeline.
Those embeddable build status configurations can be displayed in the same locations as the default embeddable build status configuration.
For example, if a Pipeline defined a build status configuration named <code>win32build</code>, that configuration can be accessed by appending <code>config=win32build</code> as one of the embeddable build status URL parameters.
