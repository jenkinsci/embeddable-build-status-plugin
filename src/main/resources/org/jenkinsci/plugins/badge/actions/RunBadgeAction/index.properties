blurb=Jenkins exposes the current status of your build as an image in a fixed URL. \
      You can put this URL into other sites (such as GitHub README) so that people \
      can see the current state of the build. \
      <br>For each variant there are two URLs available for inclusion: <br> \
      <ul>  \
       <li><b>protected</b> exposes the badge to users having at least 'Read' permission on the job</li> \
       <li><b>unprotected</b> exposes the badge to users having at least 'ViewStatus' permission on the job</li> \
      </ul> \
      If you want the status icons to be public readable/accessible, just grant the 'ViewStatus' permission globally to 'anonymous'. \
      <h2>Note</h2>\
      If you are using <b>Multibranch Pipelines</b> the <b>branch</b> within the job path or name needs to be URL encoded <b style="color: red">twice</b>.<br/><br/> \
      <b>Example:</b><br/> \
      <code>?job=<span style="color: blue">path/to/job</span>/<b style="color: red">branch/path</b></code><br/> \
      would become<br/> \
      <code>?job=<span style="color: blue">path%2Fto%2Fjob</span>%2F<b style="color: red">branch%252Fpath</b></code><br/><br/> \
      <b>See examples below!</b> \
      <h2>Configuration</h2> \
      Please read <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/embeddable-build-status-plugin#embeddable-build-status-plugin">here</a> on how to configure and customize your badge.

blurb_text=Jenkins also exposes the current status of your build in plain text. \
      You can use this in external scripts for easier interpretation of the current state of the build. \
      Similar to the badge there are both <b>with view</b> and <b>without view</b> for <b>protected</b>, as well as <b>unprotected</b> variants.
