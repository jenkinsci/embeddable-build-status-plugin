blurb=Jenkins exposes the current status of your build as an image in a fixed URL. \
      You can put this URL into other sites (such as GitHub README) so that people \
      can see the current state of the build. \
      <br>For each variant there are two URLs available for inclusion: <br> \
      <ul>  \
       <li><strong>protected</strong> exposes the badge to users having at least 'Read' permission on the job</li> \
       <li><strong>unprotected</strong> exposes the badge to users having at least 'ViewStatus' permission on the job</li> \
      </ul> \
      If you want the status icons to be public readable/accessible, just grant the 'ViewStatus' permission globally to 'anonymous'. \
      <h2>Note</h2>\
      If you are using <strong>Multibranch Pipelines</strong> the <strong>branch</strong> within the job path or name needs to be URL encoded <strong>twice</strong>.<br/><br/> \
      <strong>Example:</strong><br/> \
      <code>?job=path/to/job/branch/path</code><br/> \
      would become<br/> \
      <code>?job=path%2Fto%2Fjob%2Fbranch%252Fpath</code><br/><br/> \
      <strong>See examples below!</strong> \
      <h2>Configuration</h2> \
      Please read the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/embeddable-build-status/">documentation</a> to configure and customize your badge.

blurb_text=Jenkins also exposes the current status of your build in plain text. \
      You can use this in external scripts for easier interpretation of the current state of the build. \
      Similar to the badge there are both <strong>protected</strong>, as well as <strong>unprotected</strong> variants.
